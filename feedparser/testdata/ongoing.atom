<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>As usual, it all started out innocently enough. Susan [ed: names have been
changed to protect privacy] had no way to meet the deadlines her bosses had
set for her. Bob had recently and abruptly left the company, and Melissa was
on an extended medical absence, leaving Susan to do the work of three
people. That is, three people each trying to reconcile a few dozen 40,000+ row
Excel spreadsheets representing the general ledger of the Fortune 1000 company
they consulted for. She was about to brush off ever-chatty and annoying
Michael from Compliance when, for once, he recognized the stress she was under
and said something useful.</p> 
<blockquote><p><i>[Tim here: I didn’t write this! I read it on a mailing list,
uh, 
somewhere, by Dave, uh, somebody, and I asked Dave “Where’d you get that? I
wanna link to it!” and Dave said “I wrote it, go ahead and share it.”  Dave
doesn’t have a canonical URL, he says, but this gentleman clearly needs a
blog.]</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Useful and dangerous, that is.</p>
 <p>“Hey, let me give you something that’ll help. A friend introduced it to
 me, and it’s made my life amazingly easy ever since,” he said. He handed her
 a USB stick.</p> 
<p>Susan was understandably wary – the security team was always harping on not
plugging in USB devices from untrusted sources, and Michael wasn’t exactly the
type she would want to hang out with after work. But security didn’t have to
close the books, either, so she reluctantly accepted it and plugged it into
her workstation. Virus scans came up clean, and there was just one file on
it:SQLite_Installer.msi.</p>
<p>She created her schemas and loaded the CSV files in. Everything was
consistent. Numbers added up. The rush was incredible. For the first time
since taking this job, high strung Susan felt a rush of euphoria. The books
would close on time!</p> 
<p>Susan wasn’t a daily user at first. Just a bit to help her get through the
hard times. But a couple times a month turned into a couple times a week as
the demands mounted. Worse, SQLite was starting to fray at the edges with its
value-typing. The euphoria just wasn’t the same. Desperate, she turned to
something stronger. MySQL fit the bill and the price was still right. Data
types matched up again, and she was no longer stuck reconciling mismatched
data. Oh, how good it felt to be on top of the world again.</p> 
<p>And that was when the dealer entered into the scene. Forget your notion of
the sketchy thug with a gauche display of jewelry. No, Ashley McIntyre was a
well-articulated, friendly, and slightly diminutive lady in proper business
attire. Ashley pointed out the dangers of how Susan was using MySQL: no
backups, no way to recover the precious data she had so painstakingly entered
in. One bump on her old Dell laptop, and the high she felt now would be
nothing compared to the depression she would feel having lost all the
data. Ashley got her set up on a full Oracle installation with consultants to
get everything moved over.</p> 
<p>This was pure dopamine. Not only was it consistent, it was fast. It took
anything they threw at it. Yes, “they” – Susan had introduced others in her
department to it. It wasn’t free anymore, but – she rationalized – you get
what you pay for, right? And it easily fit within their budget.</p> 
<p>Until, one day, Ashley returned – with a team of equally well dressed thugs
from the license audit team. “You’re running this on a 32-core machine. That’s
not what you’re paying for. You’re going to have to true-up.”</p>
<p>Susan panicked. She tried to explain how it was a virtualized server –
“We’re only using two cores!” – but her pleas fell on deaf ears. The
“diminutive” Ashley was unrelenting and threatening. Susan couldn’t let the
books not close, so she had to find some way – any way – to keep the Oracle
hits coming. She did what any addict did: she stole from other departments. In
her mind, she rationalized her decision – “I’m just adding a few line entries
into their accounts; we’re just ‘moving around’ the money.” But, of course,
reality eventually caught up with her. Any legitimate accounting firm couldn’t
risk having someone on their payroll with a less-than-stellar
reputation. Officially, Susan was let go by “mutual agreement” – i.e., they
paid her a bit of severance to keep her quiet – but the reality is that she
was fired, unemployed, and – worse – unemployable.</p>
<p>Sadly, Susan was never able to get the help she desperately needed. She can now be found floating around between various DBA contractual agencies, ranting about denormalization and first-normal database schemas.</p>

 <summary type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>There&#x2019;s this nice video mes&#xad;sage in the el&#xad;e&#xad;va&#xad;tors at work, about the Pride Pa&#xad;rade. And it&#x2019;s mak&#xad;ing me un&#xad;easy.</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>There’s this nice video message in the elevators at work, about the Pride
Parade. And it’s making me uneasy.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/07/13/LRM_20160712_083018.png" class="inline" alt="Pride parade Telus marketing" />
<p>I took a picture of the message and it’s a fine thing; gives me a warm glow. Especially since
there’s going to be a big Amazon contingent in Vancouver’s parade, which
is a powerful, uplifting occasion.</p>
<p>I have some
history here: back in the Seventies, I was on the college’s student-paper
staff and we
sponsored and hyped up the first ever Gay Dance.  Pretty radical at the time;
you can’t imagine the freakout among the Engineering jocks and Aggies.
Three decades later, I have the
coolest-ever rainbow-flag sticker over the glowy apple on my Mac.
Homophobia in all its flavors seems mostly on the run.  [Disclosure: I’m a
white cishet male
<a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/">playing
at the lowest difficulty setting</a>.]</p>
<p>Now, the “<a href="http://www.telus.com/">TELUS</a>” in that Pride blurb 
is a huge Canadian telecom.
Did I mention I was uneasy? To start with, I’m profoundly unused to 
finding myself aligned with a telephone company.</p>
<p>The obvious next step would be  corporates funding shelter for the
<a href="http://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/city-releases-2016-homeless-count-results-updates-low-income-housing.aspx">army
of homeless</a> on Vancouver’s streets, including the street right
outside Telus’ building, where there’s someone sleeping on cardboard on
pavement every morning.  Then taking positive action on the
<a href="https://www.policyalternatives.ca/van-working-poverty">hundred
thousand working people</a> living in poverty in Vancouver, 
<a href="http://www.vansunkidsfund.ca/">sending kids to school hungry</a>.
And speaking of poor kids, can we expect to see corporate leadership on
addressing the problems behind the fact that
<a href="http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/05/19/first-nations-child-poverty-study.html">half of them are aboriginal</a>?</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be a problem that homeless people and hungry aboriginal kids
don’t have a parade to march in, one you can send your employees off to 
and get a diversity badge for the price of a few banners; and the employees
don’t even have to take a day off work!</p>
<p>Pride? I’m 100% supportive, and homophobia’s still there to be combated.
But I’m actually not holding my breath waiting for corporate
leadership on that other stuff.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>We were talking
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">at work</a> about Serverless: What’s
the right tooling for developers building that kind of app?  One of the
businesspeople in the room said “Won’t developers need s special UI
construction kit for Serverless apps?”
The technical people all looked blank, because REST.  Browser code doesn’t
care (nor does a new-fangled React thingie, nor an iOS/Android app)
what’s hiding behind that HTTP POST.  REST is more or less
totally dominant 
among app builders today. Is there any prospect of that changing?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What we talk about when we talk about REST</h2>
<p>HTTP CRUD.  Well, HTTPS actually these days, thank goodness. GET and POST,
maybe a little PUT if you’re daring.  Not much
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a>, to be honest.  No
deep thinking about idempotence, that I see anyhow.</p>
<p>All of which is perfectly OK, because it works.  So your server doesn’t
need to know whether it’s talking to a groovy TheNewHotness.js Single-Page 
App or a C++ Unity-engine First-Person Shooter running on a phone.  And your
SPA or FPS client doesn’t need to know whether it’s talking to a baroque Java
EE monolith or a posse of funky micro-services.  It’s only the most
successful large-scale integration architectural style in the history of
architectures.</p>
<p>[I may be pardoned a bit of glowiness about this, having spent a decade or
so shouting that objects-on-the-wire (CORBA/DCOM/etc) were a bad idea, then
another decade saying the same about SOAP, WSDL, and friends.]</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Is REST running out of gas?</h2>
<p>I don’t think so, but the app areas where you see non-RESTful deployments
are interesting.  Now, I’m talking mainstream business apps, so the use of UDP
by the real-time bits of games is a big deal, but nobody’s 
expecting to see unsequenced datagrams replacing conventional web-site
networking.</p>
<p>But what <em>is</em> interesting is streaming.  I’m not talking about video
streaming; that’s
<a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/software/">done with HTTP</a>,
anyhow.  I mean, for example, Slack’s
<a href="https://api.slack.com/rtm">Real Time Messaging API</a>; I bet a lot
of people reading this are in a few Slack channels, and at the moment, that’s
being done with WebSockets.</p>
<p>Which astonished me when I found out.  It’s like this: Connections across
the Internet, particularly when one end is a mobile device, are flaky,
evanescent things.  They all have one thing in common: Sooner or later, they
break. Look at that Slack documentation I linked to above; it covers how to
deal with disconnections. That’s sort of a pain for client authors, but
apparently not too awful judging by Slack’s success.  Still, a Google search
for
<a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=slack%20disconnects">slack disconnect</a>
is amusing.</p>
<p>What I can’t figure out, though, is how they manage the server-side; maybe
the technology has advanced, but I wouldn’t have the vaguest idea how to
configure a fleet to terminate a few hundred thousand WebSocket connections.
A hundred thousand HTTP transactions/second?  No problemo, these days. But
<em>persistent</em> connections?  Cool stuff; Let’s see if it catches on.</p> 
<p>I wondered aloud about this and
<a href="https://twitter.com/peterc">Peter Cooper</a> pointed me at
<a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">The Road to 2 Million Websocket Connections in Phoenix</a>,
which has impressive numbers. 
Mind you, they cheated<span class='dashes'> —</span> they
used Erlang.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Streaming for volume</h2>
<p>There’s one scenario where I’ve become convinced that HTTP is stupid and
wasteful.  That’s where you have a <em>small</em> number of parties (like, for
example, two) exchanging
a <em>huge</em> number of messages.  At some point, streaming <em>has</em> to
win, right?  Well yeah, but gosh, HTTP is still hard to let go of.  There’s
<em>so much</em> machinery there for it: authentication and encryption and
routing and benchmarking and tracing and caching, so much a part of the
ecosystem that you mostly don’t have to think about it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, seems pretty likely that the next little bit of the future will stay
REST-centric.  One of the nice things about that is you can think about
changing out your server-side architectures, like for example going
serverless, without breaking the world.</p>

<p>I’m sure you know the feeling<span class='dashes'> —</span> you see a link
to something that looks interesting, follow it, and when it turns out to be a
video clip, you shake your head and kill the tab.  The problem with video is
it’s just too slow.  But sometimes slow is OK, and maybe video can be
fixed.</p> 
<p>This was provoked by
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/22/i-have-found-a-new-way-to-watch-tv-and-it-changes-everything/">I have found a new way to watch TV, and it changes everything</a>
by Jeff Guo,
which recommends watching video, by default, in fast-forward mode.  The
pitch is compelling, I’ll probably pick the habit up.  Right now
I watch almost no Web video, but maybe that’ll change.  Seriously, go read
Guo’s piece, it’s challenging. Out-take: “In a way, what’s happening to video
recalls what happened to literature when we stopped reading aloud, together,
and started reading silently, alone.”</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Voice too!</h2>
<p>Overclocked audio is one of the big features in Marco Arment’s
super-successful
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overcast_(app)">Overcast</a>
pod-catcher; you can get through a voice presentation immensely faster than
you’d think without information loss.</p>
<p>Which I’d known since the Nineties. Way back in the day I was
working at
<a href="http://www.opentext.com/">Open Text</a>, which at that time was
pretty well 100% server-side software.  Our QA lead was this brilliant guy
who happened to be blind. He was one of our major assets, but most people
didn’t want to sit too near him, because he did everything with audio, only
speeded up by some huge factor, so there was this continuous high-pitched
gabble of ultra-fast voice reading server logs and source-code listings.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Video sucks</h2>
<p>As a method of communicating information, I mean.  When you’re using the
Internet to learn about what’s happening in the world, you want words in a
row.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees.
<a href="http://qz.com/706461/facebook-is-predicting-the-end-of-the-written-word/">Check
this out</a>: “The best way to tell stories
in this world, where so much information is coming at us, actually is video,”
Mendelsohn said. “It conveys so much more information in a much quicker
period. So actually the trend helps us to digest much more information.”
That’s Facebook’s Nicola Mendelsohn.</p>
<p>But I’m pretty sure she’s wrong.  Check out these
two Tweet sequences from US political uber-blogger
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall">Josh Marshall</a>, the
first of which starts with the Mendelson assertion.  Outtake:
<a href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/746850103516868609">But the reality is that news consumers don't want video. It is sometimes successfully forced on them.</a></p>
<p>The second sequence, just as interesting, starts with
<a href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/747057398255329280">A lot of
reactions to my comment on video for news/politics sites. Some oddly sensitive
from certain VC-backed outlets.</a></p>
<p>I suspect most Net-head news-junkies will agree fervently.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It doesn’t always suck</h2>
<p>There are exceptions, chiefly live cameras pointed at live news.  To this
day I remember, in June 1989, sitting for hours like a garden vegetable,
watching the live feed from Tiananmen Square.  Same story with Gaza wars and
legislative sit-ins and Olympic torch-lighting.  And of course live sports;
baseball can be agonizingly slow, but that’s the price of love.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What can’t you speed up?</h2>
<p>To start with, some video.  The British Film
Institute helpfully
<a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/16-incredible-long-takes">lists
sixteen great cinematic long cuts</a>.  I found that page by searching by
“long take Tarkovsky” which will tip you off that I was profoundly moved by
the six-minute one-shot (but sadly, not one take) finale of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sacrifice">The Sacrifice</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s another example: Recently
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigur_R%C3%B3s">Sigur Rós</a> offered
<a href="http://sigur-ros.co.uk/routeone/">Route One</a> (hm, that link
currently doesn’t work), 24 hours of live-streamed video of a drive
round Iceland, backed by their space-fluff ear-candy.  The video was kind of
low-rez and I’m not even a huge fan of their music, but I spent 90 minutes on
Route One with them and don’t regret a second.</p>
<p>And so, music.  Speeding up recorded music would be the lowest philistinism
imaginable, but messing with a song’s speed is a long and honorable
tradition.  Cosider J.J. Cale’s original lilting lope through <cite>After
Midnight</cite>, and compare Clapton’s live hell-for-leather dash through it on
1979’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_One_Night_(Eric_Clapton_album)">Just
One Night</a>.  I wouldn’t want the world to be without either.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The rest</h2>
<p>For your convenience, here is a comprehensive list of things for which
there’s a proper pace that really oughtn’t be sped up.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Eating</p></li>
<li><p>Drinking</p></li>
<li><p>… or really any path to altered states of consciousness</p></li>
<li><p>Walking in the woods</p></li>
<li><p>Any activity for which beds are designed</p></li>
<li><p>Dancing</p></li>
<li><p>Considering alternatives</p></li>

Here&#x2019;s a map.</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Following on the British EU referendum, some political re-alignment of the
British Isles feels inevitable. I propose a re-organization into three states:
Ireland, Britain, and Dál Riata (or perhaps Dalriada) which comprises what we
now call Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Here’s a map.</p>
<img src="british-isles.png" alt="The British Isles" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Vital Statistics</h2>
<p>Britain remains the big dog; but the new kid on the block is no slouch;
about the same population as Bulgaria (less than Switzerland, more than
Denmark) and about as big as Hungary (smaller than Iceland, bigger than Portugal).</p>
<table >
<tr><td class="empty"></td>
<th>Britain</th><th>Dál Riata</th><th>Ireland</th></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Population (M)</th><td>56.1</td><td>7.1</td><td>4.6</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><th>Area (km<sup>2</sup>)</th><td>130,395</td><td>94,620</td><td>70,273</td></tr>
</table>
<h2 id='p-2'>Dál What?</h2>
<p>The names are pretty easy; Ireland already has one, and what was once The
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland loses its second half and
is a little less “Great”, so “Britain” falls out
naturally.</p>
<p>As for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata">Dál Riata</a>, that was
the name of an early Gaelic “overkingdom” that occupied Ulster and quite a bit
of Western Scotland starting around 500 AD, suffered a terrible military defeat
at the battle of Mag Rath in 647, but still appeared in contemporary documents
into the mid-800s.  The best outline of its history I found online was at
<a href="http://www.scottishhistory.com/articles/early/settlement/settlement_page1.html">ScottishHistory.com</a>,
under the name “Dalriada”, which is also pretty nice.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Advantages</h2>
<p>The other proposals being floated are for Northern Ireland to join Ireland,
and Scotland to go indie.  Neither of these ideas sound terrible, but there’s
an ugly weight of Irish history to work around in the first case, and
Scotland plus Ulster makes for a usefully weightier combo than either alone,
it seems.</p>
<p>Also, their administrative infrastructures, inherited from the
UK, would fit together nicely without too much redesign required.</p>
<p>They’re both wet grey-and-green nations with irregular spelling and good distilleries.  Historically, the travel and migration back and forth
has been regular, ranging into promiscuous/incestuous territory; the DNA pools
are hardly separable anyhow.</p>
<p>Then there are sports; I can see the Dál Riatan side being one to watch in
football, rugby, and cricket; and they’d really enjoy their occasional upset
victories over the British.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Problems</h2>
<p>The toughest one I see is where to put the capital.  The most interesting
and cosmopolitan city in Dál Riata would be Glasgow, but that’s a long way
from Belfast.</p>
<p>You could adopt an approach like Canada and Australia did, and build or
enlarge a spot halfway between; a candidate might be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbeltown">Campbeltown</a> on the
Kintyre peninsula, or alternatively repurpose the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Arran">Isle of Arran</a>.</p>
<p>Then you’re going to have to invent a constitution. No-one will miss the
monarchy much, and it seems like a good opportunity to adopt some
psephological innovations along the lines of proportional representation or
single-transferable vote.</p>
<p>Then there’s the three-way relationship to figure out.  Obviously Ireland
will stay in the EU and I can’t see the Euros not welcoming the Dál Riatans
with open arms.  Schengen-style open borders might be hard to achieve;
but I can’t see anyone seriously taking up tariffs.</p>
<p>Whisky vs Whiskey would only be a problem for the small-minded.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Precedents and disclosures</h2>
<p>After the Americans disastrously re-elected Dubya in 2004, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/04/NewNorthAmerica">proposed redividing
North America</a> into three nations, and it seemed to entertain a lot of
people, so why not try again?  And this map is way more plausible than that
one.</p>
<p>Also, if you look at my ancestry, it’s a quarter Norwegian and the rest is
pretty well Orange and Scottish.  So if they do get together and create Dál
Riata, I feel this blog piece has earned me honorary citizenship and a
comprehensive whisky/whiskey tour.</p>

<p>I just finished reading
<a href="http://amzn.to/28NkRdl">The Library at Mount Char</a> by
<a href="http://www.shawkins.net/">Scott Hawkins</a>, who also writes 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scott-Hawkins/e/B00MCIWP1K/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1">geek
books</a> about 
Linux and Apache and so on.
I enjoyed it, it’s a page-turner.  One of the reviewers on Amazon said “This
is what Gaiman’s
<cite><a href="http://amzn.to/1PA1kRQ">American Gods</a></cite> should have
been.” 
I’m not sure
I’d go that far, but both address the tricky problem of divine personae lodged
in Middle America.</p>
<img src="tlamc.png" alt="The Library at Mount Char cover" class="inline" />
<p>It’s a big sprawling messy book with subdivisions and malls and
trucker bars, and then there’s Father,
a heartless God who fosters young Americans and trains them up, what business
people call
“succession planning”.  The training involves infinite time
and infinite cruelty, and on the occasion of that succession the consequences
are really not good for the neighbohood, comprising the Earth.</p>
<p>For all the cosmic fireworks, the story’s mostly tactical and local and
suburban. The characters who aren’t divine are compelling and fun, while the
deranged-flyover-zone-deity villains ooze terror and, weirdly, pity.</p>
<p>Plus, there are a couple of lions who will leave a mark on you.</p>
<p>And then there’s Carolyn, our protagonist, who’s both human and divine,
ruthless and sympathetic, full of surprises; a novelist’s triumph and a
character I’m really, really glad to have spent four hundred pages with.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>I just finished reading
<a href="http://amzn.to/1tlMom9">1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization
Collapsed</a>, and enjoyed it a lot. You might not though, unless you’re
interested 
in the ancient Near East (from Greece to Egypt inclusive), or the practice
of archaeology.  Well, or the large-scale systemic collapse of great
empires.</p>
<img src="1177cover.png" alt="1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed" class="inline" />
<p>It turns out that in the centuries leading up to 1200 B.C., this part of
the world was 
mostly occupied by biggish Bronze-Age nations: Egyptian, Hittite, Mittani,
Babylonian &amp; Assyrian, Mycenaean.  Trade was brisk and
multipolar. Culture mashups happened; you can find Cretan frescoes in Egyptian
palaces of the day.  But by 1130 it was all over; most great cities had
burned, commerce had collapsed, and alphabets were starting to replace the
cuneiform, hieroglyphic, and linear scripts.</p>
<p>In 1177 B.C., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_III">Ramses
III</a> fought (and won) a well-documented war against the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples">Sea Peoples</a>, whose
identity remains shadowy; as good a reason as any to pick that year as the
fulcrum of the disaster.</p>
<p>For a long time, it was popularly believed that those Sea Peoples were the
knife in the heart of the Bronze Age.  After all, Ramses said so:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The foreign countries made a conspiracy in
their islands, All at once the lands were removed and scattered in the
fray. No land could stand before their arms: from Hatti, Qode, Carchemish,
Arzawa and Alashiya on, being cut off at one time. A camp was
set up in Amurru. They desolated its people, and its land was like that which
has never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt, while the
flame was prepared before them. Their confederation was the Peleset, Tjeker,
Shekelesh, Denyen and Weshesh, lands united. They laid their hands upon the
land as far as the circuit of the earth, their hearts confident and trusting:
“Our plans will succeed!”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Archaeologists these days mostly don’t buy that theory.
So, what brought
everything down?  <i>[Spoiler alert!  Stop reading now if you don’t want the
reveal.]</i></p>
<p>The short answer is, we don’t really know. The long answer is this book,
more or less.  Author
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_H._Cline">Eric H. Cline</a> has
fun with it, giving an overview of what we know about the Bronze Age’s good
times, and then diving deep on the bad ones.  Yes, the “Sea Peoples” quite
likely contributed.  But then, there was also climate change, and plagues, and
a lot of earthquakes.  Cline considers each of these carefully, and you may
find yourself developing your own theory of the catastrophe’s cause.</p>
<p>The amount of written-at-the-time records that remain is surprisingly
large, but obviously full of holes, and ignores issues that would seem
important to us.  But there is still a whole lot of character and color: You
get to meet lots of different royal personages (both genders), and a few
merchants, and read what they wrote to each other.</p>
<p>The names are wonderful; of the people I mean, and the names the nations
called each other. The only that you might have heard are those of a pharaoh
or two.</p>
<p>This patch of history notably includes the Hebrew Exodus, if the consensus
on biblical dates is correct.
Cline takes a look through the archaeology, but there’s no
there there.  I guess that in science, a negative result is still a
result: independent supporting evidence for the Exodus legend just isn’t
there.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the book has lots of interesting pictures.  In the Kindle edition,
the resolutions aren’t very good; when I enlarge them to fill my Nexus-7
screen, they get pixellated.  That’s really a pity.</p>
<p>I would prefer to avoid living through an empire’s end-times. But reading
about them is good fun.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>I have a problem lately: When I look in the mirror, I see a
left-wing extremist.  
I’m uneasy about my
strengthening belief that Free Enterprise is gonna ruin everything good
unless we take a knife to its
testicles first.</p>
<p>I think we need to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tax the crap out of the 1% [disclosure: I’m one],</p></li>
<li><p>stamp out most forms of high-leverage financial speculation,</p></li>
<li><p>introduce ruthless transparency such that any asset whose
beneficial ownership cannot be established where legally appropriate
is subject to summary confiscation,</p></li>
<li><p>adopt a zero-tolerance posture on business crime, with jail time
regularly administered for significant financial misdeeds, in rough proportion
to the size of the takings, and</p></li>
<li><p>roll out a universal basic income to deal with the
inevitable decline in the proportion of humans “enjoying” full employment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I think we can all agree that these are extreme measures. And inside, I
feel like this reasonable mild-mannered guy.  But there’s overwhelming
evidence that we’re facing extreme problems; read on.</p>
<p>Taking these steps would require strong unpleasant language
and make many powerful and persuasive people unhappy. At the
moment, the critical mass to make these things happen isn’t there. But it
feels to me like it’s steadily less and less not-there.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Readings</h2>
<p>I’ll spare you paragraphs of my own discourse: As a political
rhetorician, I’m a fine software geek.  
But there’s some awfully good,
awfully strong things being said out there; here are some:</p>
<p><a href="https://morecrows.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/unnecessariat/">Unnecessariat</a>
by “Anne Amnesia” is messy, disorganized, data-dense, and darkly
beautiful, a 
raw scream out of the raw parts of Middle America.  Out-take: “Lets be
honest- Clinton doesn’t give a shit about me. When Clinton talks about people
hurt by the economy, she means you: elite-educated white-collar people with
obvious career tracks who are having trouble with their bills and their 401k
plans. That’s who boomed under the last president Clinton, especially the
401ks. Me, or the three guys fighting two nights ago over the Township mowing
contract, we’re nothing. Clinton doesn’t have an economic plan for us. Nobody
has an economic plan for us. There is no economic plan for us, ever. We keep
driving trucks around and keep the margins above gas money and maybe take an
odd job here or there, but essentially, we’re history and nobody seems to mind
saying so.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/04/on-revolutionary-attitude/">On
Revolutionary Attitude</a> by Craig Murray is way more British and polished
than <cite>Unnecessariat</cite> but perhaps even angrier:  “Society is so obviously
broken to the disadvantage of the many, that to indulge those who, from
self-interest or media brainwashing or nostalgia, support the status quo is
not helpful.”</p>
<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-miss-manufacturing-they-miss-unions/">Americans Don’t Miss Manufacturing — They Miss Unions</a>,
from Ben Casselman at stats-wonk site <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite>, is
unsurprisingly data-heavy: “a third of production workers — non-managers
working on factory floors and in related occupations — earn so little that
their families receive some form of public assistance such as food stamps or
the Earned Income Tax Credit”.</p>
<p>Finally,
<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/north-carolna">On Some Issues,
Moral Appeals Don't Seem To Work</a> by John Judis at big-league US-liberal
blog <cite>TPM</cite>, is short but focused on a point I want to
expand on: While you can rally round and move the needle on social-liberal
projects (in this case the US Deep South’s  Neanderthal anti-sexual-minority
laws), nobody is willing to do much about the poor, who are getting crapped on
at least as comprehensively as trans people.</p>
<p>Anne Amnesia echoes this: At some point starting in the Seventies,
the gay community woke up and wouldn’t take it any more, and they’ve 
won a lot of their fights. The powers that be realized, first, that it was
stupid and indefensible to discriminate against people for being born that
way; and second (more important) it wouldn’t cost them anything to stop
discriminating.</p>
<p>Which is why, obviously, it’s easier to address the issues of smaller
factions like the LGBTQers, than the big race and gender power issues, which
you can’t touch without major economic dislocation.</p>
<p>I wonder, now that the social-progressive program is largely (thank
goodness) scoring wins, whether we might direct some of that awesome energy to
economic-progressive ends.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Questions</h2>
<p><i>“Are you a Marxist?”</i>  I don’t think so, and I’ve even read Marx.
While he said smart things about class conflict and talked about
“workers alienated from the means of production” (translation: a lot of jobs
suck), Marx didn’t say much useful about how to fix the problem, and was
appallingly data-illiterate (<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2014/05/01/Piketty-Capital">see Piketty</a>).  Anyhow, even if he was right,
there isn’t a proletariat any more.</p>
<p><i>“But if you cripple the Free Market, won’t that plunge us into poverty?”</i>
It might; the free market is one of <i>Homo sapiens’</i> greatest
inventions.  But it’s profoundly artificial, relies on the Rule of Law and a
functioning court system and a central bank and all sorts of other
public apparatus.</p>
<p>And it’s here to serve us, not the other way round. Guess what: If the
executive class were whacked back to the single-digit millions they
accumulated a few decades back, instead of all the zeroes they accumulate now,
there’d still be lots of people knocking themselves out to build companies and
be the boss.</p>
<p>Let me
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2014/05/01/Piketty-Capital">quote Piketty</a>: “There is no statistically significant relationship
between the decrease in top marginal tax rates and the rate of productivity
growth in the developed countries since 1980.”</p>
<p>I remember having lunch with some Deutsche Bank execs in 2009, with lots of
financial-crisis blood still on the floor.  They were feeling sorry for
themselves: “These politicos don’t get the market, they want to regulate the
hell out of us, make the banking system run like the civil service.”  Hm,
that doesn’t sound obviously worse than the way the banking system runs
today.  But it was the cloud-castle sense of entitlement that, all these years
in the distant rear-view, still makes me angry.</p>
<p><i>“Won’t technology create enough jobs to replace the ones it’s
destroying, like it always has?”</i> Maybe, but I don’t think so.  In
particular, I think self-driving vehicles are going to blow a hole in
employment for the relatively-unskilled that may never heal.</p>
<p><i>“But this century has seen massive poverty reduction in Asia, are you
against that?”</i> No, and I hope that the Indians manage to repeat the China
trick.  But I don’t see any reason why the emergent Asian middle class isn’t
gong to end up whipsawed just like Middle America’s is, once the manufacturing
boom eases off.</p>
<p>“But what about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality">intersectionality</a>?”
Seems to me that the nastiness I observe in the world is way better explained
by old-fashioned economic class interests than by any intersectional theory
I’ve read.  Lots of socially-progressive Silly Valley titans are working
diligently to disempower workers by turning them into “independent
contractors”.</p> 
<h2 id='p-4'>Next?</h2>
<p>Well, that’s the problem.  I’ve presented my best policy ideas above but,
like I said, I’m a server-side Net geek not a political economist.  Anyone
know any political parties with ideas like those?
If I were American, I’d be in the Sanders/Warren
camp. In Canada, I usually vote NDP, but without much joy.</p>
<p>I think the ground is fertile. I think the “conventional wisdom” which
sustains the current finance-centric <i>rentier</i> economy is thought wise by
fewer and fewer. I think the path from here to something saner will have messy
and ugly parts.  But I’m increasingly sure that our current path, as a society
and species, is unsustainable.</p>

<p>You hear talk about Internet overload/addiction, but this very specific
form has crossed my radar multiple times in recent days.  In students,
specifically.  To the extent of failing multiple courses.  Because they use
laptops for everything, and YouTube is always a Cmd-Tab away, and whether your
itch is Team Fortress 2 or cat breeding or string quartets or tentacles,
there’s always something new and fresh there to scratch it. So teachers don’t
get heard and homework doesn’t get done.  My hunch is it’s a real thing.
Anyone else?</p>

<p><a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2016/04/30/JSON-Schema-funnies">Recently</a> I
wrote of my disgruntlement with
<a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>. Since then I’ve  learned
that its authors plan more work, and that there are several other efforts
to build a schema facility for JSON.  This note is just a complaint about a
particular use-case, with the hope that it might inform these efforts.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem; the language I’m building includes a big object whose
fields are also objects, and each of these child objects has a
<code>Type</code> field, whose value is, in effect, an enum; a constrained set
of string values. The rest of the fields in each child object depend on the
<code>Type</code> value.</p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<pre><code>
{
  "o1": {
    "Type": "Animal",
    ... other fields specific to Animal ...
  },
  "o2": {
    "Type": "Vegetable",
    ... other fields specific to Vegetable ...
  },
  "o3": {
    "Type": "Mineral",
    ... other fields specific to Mineral
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>In JSON Schema it’s easy enough to use a <code>oneOf</code> construct to
describe what you want, but here’s the problem: when you syntax-check 
these, the error messages go right off the rails.  For example, suppose my
schema says that if <code>Type</code> is <code>Mineral</code>, then there must
be a boolean-valued <code>Organic</code> field.  And then suppose I try to
validate a doc with an object that has <code>"Type": "Mineral"</code> and
<code>"Organic": 42</code>.</p> 
<p>The validators I’ve been working with give me a massively unhelpful flurry
of messages saying that:</p>
<o>
<li><p>This can’t be <code>Animal</code> because the <code>Type</code> is
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>This can’t be <code>Vegetable</code> because the <code>Type</code> is
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>This can’t be <code>Mineral</code> because the <code>Organic</code> is
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>This can’t be a valid instance because the <code>oneOf</code> doesn’t
match.</p></li>
</o>
<p>Of these, only one error message is helpful; but I don’t see any way to
write a schema processor to report what’s really wrong in a human-friendly
way.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I can think of specific recommendations for schema-language design
that fall out of this observation. But I’m not building any of them so I’ll
stick with just reporting the use-case.</p>

<p>I just enjoyed reading
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-search-for-our-missing-colors">The Search for Our Missing Colors</a>
by Amos Zeeberg in <cite>The New Yorker</cite>, and it gives me mental
wire to hang some words and pictures on color and its absence.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Color is hard</h2>
<p>I spent a few years in the publishing-technology business. I’d go to the
conferences, and there’d always be seminars and boot-camps on Color.  Like,
twelve hours over two days, advertised as “An introduction to a few of the
basic issues in color.”</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/05/04/FXT15935.png" alt="Tulips" />
<div class='caption'><p>Lightly processed: backed off the highlights,<br/>
darkened
the darks, sharpened a bit. And applied Lightroom’s PROVIA/STANDARD
profile.</p></div>
<p>Spend a little while digging into gamuts and color spaces and Pantone and
CMYK and transmission and emission and reflection and so on, and you’ll see
what they mean.</p>
<p>Computer programmers are, uh, what’s the word for “worse than ignorant”?  We
absorb this notion that you can express everything you need to in three 8-bit
values for R, G, and B (well, 4 values if you have an alpha channel).
Which is deeply wrong.  These days, the wrongness doesn’t matter <em>that</em>
much unless you’re doing print.  But if the Zeeberg article is right, maybe
Web-design geeks will start having to do grown-up color for the screens of
tomorrow.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/05/04/FXT15648.png" alt="Seashell" />
<div class='caption'><p>Quite heavily processed; bumped the color saturation
in the shell while turning it down in the tabletop and, well, pushed a lot of
other sliders back and forth. Which results in the picture looking to me like
the way the shell did.</p></div>
<p>Having said that, I don’t want to diss the 24-bit RGB space that much;
among other things, I once had fun 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/19/RGBPlane">generating 768 256x256 color
planes</a> to expore it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Should photos be in color?</h2>
<p><a href="http://theonlinephotographer.com">Mike Johnston</a>, my personal
favorite photo-blogger, has been known to argue that you should generally shoot
B&amp;W, because shape and proportion and shading are at the center
of photography.  I don’t agree at all, but there’s a lot to think about in
that argument.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/05/04/FXT15773.png" alt="Boards" />
<div class='caption'><p>Very nearly straight-outta-the-camera; blackened the
blacks a bit to intensify the spaces between the boards.  Oh, and I’m
cheating; this is a full-color image.</p></div>
<p>If you think that’s an interesting point of view, you’d probably really
enjoy his
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2014/11/one-camera-one-lens-one-year-the-digital-version.html">One
Camera, One Lens, One Year</a> challenge. I’ve never tried that diet, but the
proportion of my photos that are via the Fuji 35mm/F1.4 + X-T1 combo is
trending toward 100%, so I might as well be.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I like pretty colors.  But this last couple of years, I’ve found
myself more willing, when I notice strong shapes in a photo, to start
exploring the B&amp;W space.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to this.  First, just slide the “Saturation” knob
in Lightroom all the way left.  Second, pull out the nuclear cannon, by which
I mean Silver Efex Pro.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>I find myself tasked with polishing and publishing a little custom
JSON-encoded language.  It’s harder than it ought to be.</p>
<p>This didn’t start with the language, it started with prototype software
this guy wrote, that did something old and familiar in a new and dramatically
better way. He
replaced a bunch of gnarly old code with a few JSON templates to save time.
Now, in the rearview, the JSON looks like an important part of an important
product.</p>
<p>And there’s a lesson in that: All the good markup vocabularies are
discovered by coders trying to get shit done, not cooked up in committee rooms
in advance of software.  For example, TimBL just needed to tag his
hypertexts.  Not that this is that big.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Q: Why JSON?</h2>
<p>If it looks like a document, use XML.  If it looks like an object, use
JSON.  It’s that simple.  The essential difference isn’t simplicity/complexity
or compact/verbose or typed/text, it’s ordered-by-default or not.</p>
<p>This particular thing I’m working on is a lot like objects and not at all
like documents.  Case closed.</p>
<p>By the way, it’s amusing that this century hasn’t yet offered a plausible
new markup alternative to the last one’s mouldy leftovers.  Also pleasing to
one who has left fingerprints on both leftovers.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Q: How to author?</h2>
<p>With pain.  By default, I write things in Emacs, which unaccountably
doesn’t have a JSON mode that knows <em>where to put the fucking
commas</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried editing JSON in IntelliJ and it’s not terrible but not
remotely good enough. I’m writing what you’re now reading in XML in an Emacs
mode that’s a fantastically-productive finely-tuned machine, so the thing
should be possible.</p>
<p>There’s another solution: make JSON easier.
<a href="https://hjson.org/">Hjson</a> (“the Human JSON”) addresses this
problem and looks quite cleanly thought out.  There’s also
<a href="http://json5.org/">JSON5</a> (“JSON for the ES5 era”), but I stopped
reading at “Unicode characters and escape sequences aren’t yet supported”.</p>
<p>Meh.  Fewer markup languages are better; fix the editors, I say.  Maybe
Amazon would be OK with me dropping all this cloud stuff and working on JSON
authoring tools for a few months?  Not holding my breath.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Q: How to specify?</h2>
<p>If you want to ship your own language, you need to specify it.  The most
important
part of any language spec is the human-readable prose that describes the
constructs, says what they mean, and offers advice on how to use them.</p>
<p>Next most important is examples; lots of ’em, well-chosen, and downloadable
from somewhere.</p>
<p>(Actually, if you ever find yourself tasked with specifying something, go
read Mark Pilgrim’s
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051016203842/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs">Why
specs matter</a>, which clarifies your task: Turning morons into experts.)</p>
<p>Next most important, an open-source validator, so people can check their
efforts; it should have helpful error messages which include line and column
numbers.</p>
<p>Now, to write the validator, a schema will help, and you should write one
anyhow; if you’re like most people, writing down the formalisms will probably
shake out some bugs and sloppy thinking in your mental model of your
language.</p>
<p>Having a schema is a lousy way to <em>explain</em> a language, and it only
solves part of the validation problem, because any nontrivial language will
have semantic constraints that you can’t capture declaratively.</p>
<p>But like I said, you should write one anyhow.  Which means that if your
language is JSON-based, it sucks to be you, because
<a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> is a big fat
pool of pain.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>JSON Schema, sigh</h2>
<p>If you find yourself needing to use it, run don’t walk over to
<a href="http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/index.html">Understanding
JSON Schema</a>, which has lots of examples and reasonably human-readable
narrative; a nice piece of work.</p>
<p>In its first paragraph, it says “learning to use [JSON
Schema] by reading its specification is like learning to drive a car by
looking at its blueprints.”
They’re being tactful; the JSON Schema spec is really not very good at all.  I
don’t think this is a controversial thing to say, but let me offer some
evidence anyhow.</p>
<p>Most obvious: There are multiple pieces of software out there that claim to
implement JSON Schema, and their behavior is really inconsistent, in my
experience.</p> 
<p>One area where I observe inconsistencies is in the handling of the
“$ref” construct.  Irritated, I decided to go check the official spec. “$ref”
is not defined (but is used) in
<a href="http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html">JSON Schema
Core</a>. Same for
<a href="http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html">JSSON
Schema Validation</a>. 
Same for
<a href="http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-hypermedia.html">JSON
Hyper-Schema</a>. 
Same for the
<a href="http://json-schema.org/schema">Core/Validation Meta-Schema</a> and
the
<a href="http://json-schema.org/hyper-schema">Hyper Meta-Schema</a></p>
<p>Actually, I could be wrong; the spec is <em>really</em> hard to read; and I
say that as one with much more experience in spec-reading and schemas than
most.</p> 
<p>When I’m defining a language, I need to work on the schema and the
validator and the examples all together, iteratively, validating things
multiple times per minute, so I need a tool that I can run from the command
line that is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Fast,</p></li>
<li><p>consistent,</p></li>
<li><p>complete, and</p></li>
<li><p>reports errors with line and column numbers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So far, I haven’t found one.
<a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> (npm) isn’t up to date with the
latest schema spec draft.  
<a href="https://github.com/ruby-json-schema/json-schema">json-schema</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/brandur/json_schema">json_schema</a> (ruby; see,
hyphen vs underscore, isn’t that quaint?) are inconsistent, particularly in
their 
handling of “$ref”, and neither of them reports line/column, and neither of
them respond sanely to JSON-level rather than schema-level errors.</p>
<p>Then there’s
<a href="https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator">json-schema-validator</a>,
but that’s in Java, which means it’s probably too slow for command-line use,
and also I’m not smart enough to run Java from the command line without 
hand-holding from an IDE or a really good build system that knows dependencies.</p>
<p>Feaugh.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>What I’m actually doing</h2>
<p>First, I’m keeping my schema in one great big file; cross-file “$ref”
handling is irremediably broken, near as I can tell.</p>
<p>Second, I’m using “json-schema” (hyphen not underbar) in a little ruby
script, which first of all runs “jsonlint” to check for basic JSON
sanity. “jsonlint” at least does line numbers, yay. ♫ <i>Ruby and Node, sittin’
in a tree…</i> ♫</p>
<p>Because I distrust the tools I’m building a Java testbed in IntelliJ that
will let me double-check
with “json-schema-validator” from time to time.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>JSON specification future?</h2>
<p>I notice that the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04">most recent JSON-Schema IETF
draft</a> expired in 2013, and that a couple of the tools have “looking for
maintainer” signs posted on them.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve mostly figured out JSON Schema, I neither love it nor hate
it.  So far, 
I’ve been able to make it do what I wanted. But it sure feels lame compared to 
<a href="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a>, in terms of polish, documentation,
and tooling.</p>
<p>This is a space that could use some work.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Everyone takes pictures everywhere now, 24/7/365.  So does
“photographer”, in the amateur sense, still mean anything?  I have pictures
and questions that say it does.</p>
<p>This is provoked by Om Malik’s
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/in-the-future-we-will-photograph-everything-and-look-at-nothing">In the Future, We Will Photograph Everything
and Look at Nothing</a> in the <cite>New Yorker</cite>.  
It quotes Sontag (de
rigeur for that subject in those pages I 
suppose), flirts with that seductive
ol’ Internet Contrarianism, says smart things about photo software in general
and and Google’s
<a href="https://www.google.com/nikcollection/">Nik Collection</a> in
particular, and has plenty of arm-wavey futurology about Evolution
and Conversation.</p>  
<p>I found the piece flat, partly because (oddly) it contains none of the
author’s photos; thus just words about pictures.
But it quotes a (professional) photographer saying “the term
‘photographer’ is changing.”</p>
<p>So if everyone is a photographer, then maybe no-one is?  But I don’t buy
it; “photographer” is still a useful word describing a class of people
who aren’t hard to distinguish with a few basic questions.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Q: Shoot faces?</h2>
<p>It’s easy to laugh at selfies, but they make people happy and that can’t be
bad.  Also they celebrate certain of
life’s moments, pulling them out to assert them special.  You can laugh at the
dweebs with the sticks but they just don’t care and I admire them for
it.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>On a Melbourne train</p></div>
<p>Also: Somewhere right now there’s a young woman who’ll lead her nation to
war, or write a book that wrenches a generation’s heart, or help make
technology that touches a billion lives.  Unlike previous generations of such
women, her biography’s early chapters will be improved by
selfies.</p>
<p>There are exceptions, but I think a photographer is apt to spend lots of
time and care on portraits, their own or others’.
No pictures are as intense as pictures
with faces in them.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Q: Keep all your pictures?</h2>
<p>Lots of people do.  In the <cite>New Yorker</cite>, Malik points out that
with two billion smartphones in daily use, the planet’s aggregate photo
inventory 
is growing like cancer. He notes that there are more pictures than anyone can
remember, and speculates that cloudy artificial intelligences will extract
emotional value from them.</p> 
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/04/14/FXT15919.png" alt="Sydney Ferry on Mosman Bay" />
<div class='caption'><p>Sydney harbour ferry on Mosman bay.<br/>
You can’t imagine how many I threw away;<br/>I was trying for a Miyazaki sort of
feel.</p></div>
<p>I think that most pictures are trash and you shouldn’t invest your
irreplaceable neurons in tracking them. </p>
<p>Which is to say, a photographer is someone who discards lots of
their own pictures.  Now, by “discard” one may mean “leave RAW files in an
archive I never look at” and that’s OK.  Me, I actually delete everything that
doesn’t give either my eyes or my emotions a thrill.</p>
<p>I propose a taxonomy of pictures-that-are-worth-keeping, grouped by “why”.
It has only two taxa: <i>because they touch my life</i> and
<i>because they please my eye</i>.  Do not throw away time guessing
whether they will touch other lives or please other eyes. The only life
whose touch-points you understand is your own, and the only eyes whose
pleasures you feel are your own.  I often want to touch other lives and
please other eyes, but all I (or you) can do is bet that their
lives or their eyes are like mine (or yours).</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Spring sun on Vancouver’s Main
Street</p></div>
<p>I don’t know about you, but the photographs I care about (including almost
all of the four thousand or so that have appeared on this blog) fire a cascade
of memory neurons when I see 
them. Which is almost frightening; how much of my brain is occupied with
remembering images I captured in the last century, as opposed to useful things
like where vacuum attachments are or what those I love want for their
birthdays?</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Q: Post-process?</h2>
<p>Well, yeah.  Malik suggests that this can be outsourced to The Cloud or The
Google.  And indeed, those services can sometimes work subtle magic.</p>
<img src="Spider-eyes.png" alt="Spider eyes" />
<div class='caption'><p>I had two pictures of this Sydney spider silhouetted
against a street-lamp. Fairly heavy Photoshoppery here.</p></div>
<p>But I, and I’m betting most photographers, totally love post-processing.
I’m old enough to remember spinning the dials on an enlarger in a darkroom,
but I don’t miss it, except perhaps the Seventies bonhomie and dope-smoking.
Tools like Lightroom and Nik go further
faster.  I’ll be honest: There are few things I enjoy more than
unloading the camera and spending a couple of hours coaxing magic out of the
pixels the sensor saw.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/04/14/LRM_20160327_121408.png" alt="Sydney sidewalk" />
<div class='caption'><p>Sydney sidewalk in the rain; a mobile-phone capture that required
a <em>lot</em> of punching up.</p></div>
<p>There’s a built-in frustration for me and I suppose any photographer: Unless
you’re in my house or get me to make a large paper print, you’ll never see any
of my pictures looking as nice as they do in Lightroom on a big modern retina
screen with decent color calibration.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Q: What’s Nik about?</h2>
<p>It’s wonderful software, full of love.  It concentrates the judgments of a
small number of people who know a whole lot about beauty and 
image-processing algorithms and lets amateurs like me apply them by clicking
on buttons and wiggling sliders.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Our friend Debbie, a lawyer in Melbourne.<br/>Processed 
with Nik Silver Efex Pro 2.</p></div>
<p>Malik says that Google making Nik free is a prelude to ignoring it and
thus putting it on the road to dusty death that beckons all unstrategic
unmaintained software.  I suspect he’s right.</p>
<p>So here’s why Google should pour love and money into Nik: It increases the
amount of beauty on the Internet.  Google profits when there are beautiful
things there to be found and displayed.</p>
<p>I’d argue
that Nik is a uniquely cost-effective lever for converting photographic
passion into images that make people go “wow”.
And further, at least in this decade, that you can’t achieve an equivalent
effect on a mobile device without a keyboard or mouse. Mobile technology wins
in lots of arenas, but can’t yet replace a general-purpose computer with
high-grade input devices.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Q: What’s a photographer?</h2>
<p>I still think the word has meaning.  If you’re getting paid to take
pictures, you qualify.  If you’re not, then you might anyhow:
Do you capture faces? <em>Check.</em> Do 
you throw away loads of pictures? <em>Check.</em>  Do you enjoy
post-processing? <em>Check.</em></p>
<p>Most important: Do you feel it in your gut, sometimes, looking at pictures
you’ve taken  and processed? <em>Check.</em></p>

<div class='caption'><p>The Victoria State Library’s Latrobe Reading Room, in
Melbourne.</p></div>
<p>If you think you might be a photographer and you’re not sharing, start now.
When others say “nice pic” it feels good.  Not as good as
<em>making</em> the pic, though.</p>

<p>As previously noted in this space, I’m a deranged audiophile, and for some
years my speakers of choice have been from
<a href="https://totemacoustic.com/en/">Totem</a>, out of Montréal.  In a
recent renovation a woofer got a dent in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_cap">dust cap</a>, where by
“dent” I mean it was pushed in.  I’m posting the
solution here in the hopes that future searchers will find it.</p>
<p>I was sitting up late listening to Coltrane and something about the sound
just wasn’t gelling.  Eventually it bothered me enough to turn on the lights
and even then it took a while to spot the problem, illustrated below.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/04/11/IMG_20160308_091252.png" alt="Totme speaker with pushed in dustcap" />
<div class='caption'><p>The round thing in the center of the lower driver is
supposed to be smooth and convex, not uneven and concave.</p></div>
<p>There’d recently been a renovation that’d required moving the speakers out
of the way; I can only conclude someone applied a blow with their butt or knee.</p>
<p>At first I thought the driver was ruined and I was sad, because these
speakers have made beautiful sound for us for years. I called the local Totem
dealer to consult and they said yeah, they could replace the driver, but it
sounded like it was just the dustcap, why didn’t I try just pulling it back
out?</p> 
<p>Easier said than done; getting a grip on a smooth curved surface is harder
than you’d think.  We tried Blue Tack. We tried duct tape.  We tried the
locking suction cup that holds up the bag of bath toys.  The problem is
that with many of these options, to get a grip you have to push down pretty
hard, which is probably not good for the music.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Enter the wizard</h2>
<p>By which I mean my practical, innovative spouse
<a href="http://laurenwood.org/">Lauren Wood</a>, who’d already
had a couple of good (albeit failed) ideas. She furrowed her brow and said “I
think hot glue will do it, but it feels a little drastic. I’ll give you a few
minutes to think about it.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t think of any other alternatives, so why not?  What she did was
get out the vacuum cleaner, take the end off, and hot-glue the vacuum pipe to
the dented dustcap.  The combination of the glue and the suction gripped
pretty hard.  The cone resisted smoothly but strongly as she pulled, but I
don’t think it ever came out as far as I’ve achieved on those occasions when
the family’s out and I crank up the Led Zep.  Anyhow, in just a few seconds,
hey-presto, it was smoothly convex.</p>
<p>Well, and festooned with gobs of glue.  But that’s OK, hot glue peels
off pretty easily, at least before it’s had a while to set.  The dustcap is
back to the right shape and, while it has a few little scars if you look
close, I call them wounds of love.  And Coltrane gels just fine now.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>It’s like this: Averages are your enemy because they hide change.  Making
graphs is easy and cheap and sometimes they uncover secrets; more of us
should do it more.</p> 
<p>What happened was, I was working on some software that takes an incoming
flow of messages and stuffs them into an 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/">Amazon Kinesis stream</a>.
Kinesis is a thing that can soak up a whole lot of data really fast; the way
it works is that you configure it with a number of “shards”, and each shard
can soak up a thousand messages per second, or a megabyte per second,
whichever comes first.  There’s nice software for reading the messages out and
doing useful stuff with them. It turns out there are lots of apps where
Kinesis or something like it<span class='dashes'> —</span> I hear that
<a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> is good too.</p>
<p>Kinesis will deal out the messages among the shards automatically if you
want, but I didn’t, I wanted to deal them out in a particular way to achieve a
particular effect.  And I was having a lot of trouble making it work, lots of
messages were falling on the floor, making me sad.</p>
<p>Which was really odd, because I’d configured this particular stream with 24
shards, the messages were averaging around 1K bytes each, and they were
arriving at only about 7 thousand per second (we say “7K TPS”).  This is a
development setup, the TPS when we go live will have lots more digits in front
of the K.  I remember when I used to think that a thousand transactions a
second was a lot.</p>
<p>When you try to stuff too much data into Kinesis, it “throttles” you,
saying “sorry, this shard is busy, wait a while or try somewhere else.”  Now,
my software was supposed to be smart enough to detect this and sensibly pick
another shard, routing around the problem.  But still, I kept hearing the
discouraging pitter-pat of messages hitting the floor.</p>
<p>So I spent quality time munging through logfiles with grep and sed and ruby
scripts, and eventually it became obvious that at certain times, <em>all</em>
of the shards were throttling me at the same time.</p>
<p>Which made no sense at all, because I had more or less three times the
number of shards I needed for the 7K TPS.  (At this point, some of the wiser
readers are already shaking their heads and laughing at me.)</p>
<p>“Gosh,” I thought, “maybe the load is uneven.”  So I ran a little script
over the logfile and computed the TPS every minute.  Still pretty flat,
between 5K and 7K TPS.  I turned the reporting interval down to ten seconds
and OMG, the numbers were all over the place.  At this point I decided to do
what I should have done off the top and graph the TPS.</p>
<img src="tps.png" alt="TPS graph" />
<p>Well, there you go.  The upstream system was highly periodic and while the
average TPS was sane, it regularly ran right
up against the capacity of the stream; at this point, my software’s pathetic
attempt to shuffle the messages from shard to shard only made things
worse.</p>
<p>How, you ask, do you graph numbers like this?  Methods vary, but mine is to
dump them into a text file whose name ends in “.csv” then have my local
operating system open it with whatever the default spreadsheet app is, select
the first column, and say “graph this”.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Credit</h2>
<p>I first, or anyhow most recently, learned this lesson from 
<a href="http://www.real-logic.co.uk/about.html">Martin Thompson</a>, at
the Goto; conference in Denmark in 2014. He’s a heavy optimization geek and
gave a speech about how he had a weird throughput problem and no matter how
he averaged the numbers they hid the problem.  Until he graphed them and saw
it. Yup.</p>

<p>Today Microsoft announced
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure
Functions</a>, joining
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs">Google Cloud Functions</a>
and (from 2014)
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/">AWS Lambda</a>.
This is fun stuff, and might be a big deal.</p>
<p>In the beginning was the server.  The last one I ever bought was from Dell;
I can remember hauling it out of the cardboard and sliding it into the rack.
I pinched a finger badly enough that there was blood on the floor.
Then I had to argue with the sysadmin over Debian vs Red Hat.</p>
<p>So, now that we have cloud biggies like the three companies named in the
first paragraph [disclosure,
I work for AWS]  nobody has to
shed blood deploying servers.  Even more
important, nobody has to find the money to buy the suckers.</p>
<p>But you do still have to have those arguments about operating systems, and
how much memory, and the load-balancing setup, and how many servers in the
rack.  Except maybe not, with Lambda and its competitors.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>GAE</h2>
<p>I can remember when Google App Engine came out.  I was working for Sun then
and totally in love with the idea.  When I write server-side code I want to
think about handling HTTP requests and passing messages and updating
databases.  I totally don’t care about operating systems and web servers and
mostly I don’t even care that much about frameworks like Node and Rails and so
on.</p>
<p>Later, when I worked for Google, I wrote a couple of App Engine apps and
that was mostly OK;  the APIs were nicely-thought-out, but I could never get
comfy
with the built-in datastore.  I honestly don’t know whether Google sees App
Engine as a success these days; but way too many people are still configuring
operating systems.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Functions</h2>
<p>So the new idea, initially from Lambda, now from all the Cloud
heavyweights, is that the natural unit of computation is a function, which
runs in response to an “Event”.  An Event could obviously be an HTTP
request, but it could also be a message in a queue or an upload arriving in a
datastore.   If you’re using
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/01/introducing-cloudwatch-events-monitor-and-rapidly-react-to-changes-in-your-amazon-web-services-resources/">CloudWatch
Events</a> on AWS [Yay, I helped write that] the
Event can be, well, more or less anything that happens in your Cloud
deployment.</p>
<p>The first time I got excited was when this engineer who sits near me told
me about his wife’s website; she’s a photographer and sells pictures,
which occasionally gets high-volume when she shoots classrooms or
graduations or whatever.</p>
<p>He was running her site on some low-rent Web framework on EC2 and it cost
him under $10/month.  Then he re-wrote it as a bunch of static
files and a couple of Lambda functions which among other things called out to
their payment processor.  There was a whole lot less code, and suddenly the
bills were under 10¢.</p>
<p>Well OK then, you’ve got my attention now.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Functions?</h2>
<p>I think there’s a lot to like about the function as the
natural unit of cloud computation.  Statelessness is good.  No local storage
is good.  Not much need for proprietary APIs is good.</p>
<p>Are they the whole solution? Obviously not; every Lambda I’ve ever looked
at is mostly callouts to databases and REST endpoints and messaging APIs.
But they really do mean that you never have to argue Debian vs Red Hat
again, and that feels like real progress.</p>
<p>I should disclose that I don’t work on Lambda, although code I wrote is
helping send lots of events from AWS services I didn’t write to Lambda
functions I didn’t write.</p>
<p>I guess saying that functions are cool is about the safest thing ever, what
with Google and Microsoft piling on board.  If you haven’t given them a try
